This repo is collection of projects done in the course 100days of python. These projects are either one time projects or updated or continued during the course.

The target audience of these courses is me and people who want to check my experience in python, web, data analytics and data science such as recruiters co-workers and curious individuals ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ.

I really enjoyd this development exp. and hope to come back to projects to finalise, polish and mold them.
